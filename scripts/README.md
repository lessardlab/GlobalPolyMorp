This directory contains a series of R scripts that handle various aspects of data preparation, model fitting, and ecological analysis. Below is an outline of the main files and their functions:

00_Functions
Description: Contains all reusable functions utilized throughout the analysis. Make sure to source this script first to ensure that the necessary functions are available for other scripts.
01_dataPrep
Description: Handles the data preparation stage, cleaning and organizing the raw data for subsequent analyses. This script ensures that data is formatted and processed for modeling.
02_EqualAreaAntAssemblages
Description: Focuses on analyzing ant assemblages within equal-area grid cells. The script is likely dedicated to preparing the data for spatial analysis and ensuring ecological comparability across regions.
03_FitModels
Description: This script handles the model fitting process. It applies statistical or machine learning models to the data prepared in the previous steps.
03_ModelswtRichness
Description: This script appears to focus on modeling species richness, possibly by comparing different models and their predictions on species richness across regions.
04_BiomeTaxa
Description: Deals with the analysis of taxonomic data across different biomes. The script likely explores how various species or taxa are distributed within specific biomes.
05_EcoRegions
Description: This script examines the distribution and characteristics of species across different ecoregions. It may involve spatial analysis or classification of ecological regions based on biodiversity.
